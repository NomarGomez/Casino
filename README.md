## About the Game
The aim in Casino is to capture cards from a layout of face up cards on the table. A card is captured by playing a matching card from hand. 
It is also possible to capture several cards at once if their values add up to the value of the card played. 
Captured cards are stored face down in front of the player who captured them and scored at the end of the play.
